I’m Brian P. Hogan, a technical content expert, software developer, teacher, and musician. I am the author of several books including [Build Websites with Hugo](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo), [Small, Sharp Software Tools](https://smallsharpsoftwaretools.com/), [tmux 2 - Productive Mouse-Free Development](http://pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux2), and [Exercises For Programmers](http://pragprog.com/book/bhwb).

I am currently the Director of Education at [Temporal Technologies](https://temporal.io/) where I’m creating resources to help developers build resiliant and reliable apps.

When I’m not writing or teaching, I’m [making music](https://bphogan.com/music).
